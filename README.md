# Total DX Library

This is a work-in-progress DX GUI Library for MTA:SA.

The library aims to replicate all of the features offered by CEGUI, but with much more customization and properties to mess around with, to give your server a unique feel.

Please note: it is not advised to use this library at the current stage, as it is still under development. Please give me a star above, or "watch" the repo, to keep notified of all future updates and releases.
